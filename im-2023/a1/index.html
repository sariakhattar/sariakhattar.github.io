    <h3>Week 2 Questions</h3>

    <h4>1.What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>
    <p>I noticed the multiple thick, green, rectangle, bar type shapes used, which covered most of the the screen and captured my attention instantly.</p>

    <h4>2.Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
    <p> - pressing green bars to enable poem to be read</p>
    <p> - hovering over poem and pressing it to pause it</p> 
    <p> - listening to poems that are being read out to you</p>
    <p> - watching the screen to read the poem </p>
    <p> - using mouse to hover over each bar</p>

    <h4>3.What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
    <p>I engaged with the use of poems on the website as i listened to them as they would play.</p>

    <h4>4.What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
    <p>I spent the most time pressing the bars and listening to the audio and pausing one to start another.</p>

    <h4>5.What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
    <p>I think the intended goal was to create intrest in poems, by creating an interactive experience the user is able to press and pause each poem and listen to the audio without having to read.
    It creates interest in poems instead of just thinking they are soemthing you have to read and not find much fun in. </p>

    <h4>6.What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h4>
    <p>I think the experience communicates it well as it is a user freindly website which provides the user all the benefits like stopping and starting each poem.</p>

    <h4>7.What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
    <p>It does get a bit boring as you are limited with what you can do. I would say 20 minutes roughly would be a good time over as many days as the user would want.</p>

    <h4>8.What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
    <p>As it is poems and they seem to go on for a while it can help you indicate how long you would like to spend for example you could watch one at a time and space it out over time.</p>

    <h3>Week 3 Questions</h3>

    <h4>9.What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
    <p>Print media such as books and poems and digital media such as the internet, ebooks as the audio plays while words get shown.</p>

    <h4>10.What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h4>
    <p>I think this interaction enables you to act how you want, you can think about it as sitting and reading a book or watching a video; most likely you will be seated and calm.</p>

    <h4>11.What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h4>
    <p>I think you should feel relaxed and calm as it is a laid back experience which allows for thought and enjoyment.</p>

    <h4>12.What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h4>
    <p>The most fustrating element would be how it feels like the poems are ongoing so you dont know when to stop and start the other one.</p>

    <h4>13.What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h4>
    <p>The most satisfying element is that you can pause each poem and start another to keep the interest and fun onteraction going.</p>
